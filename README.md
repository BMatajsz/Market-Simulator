# Market-Simulator

## Intuition

This is a medium-scale student project I came up with to extend my personal portfolio, and deepen my programming and developing knowledge. There are several goals of this project:

- Create a program using C++
- Use Object Oriented Programming concepts
- Work with databases
- Learn basic web scraping
- Learn to process and analyse data
- Extend my portfolio with a non-trivial, medium-sized project
